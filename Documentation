$ git clone https://github.com/ChazTech3030/dotfive_codingexam
$ cd ./dotfive_codingexam/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt fails for whatever reason, manual installation can be achieved:
	$ pip3 install Flask
	$ pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy
	$ pip3 install flask_bcrypt
	$ pip3 install flask_login
	$ pip3 install flask_wtf
	$ pip3 install email_validator

$ python3
>>> from application import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()

$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=Development
$ flask run

from a browser, navigate to:
	localhost:5000/home
	OR
	127.0.0.1:5000/home

What was not achieved that must have been implemented was automatic updating when multiple users are logged in. Due to self-appointed time constraints, this was not achieved, although if I were to spend more time on this, I'm not entirely sure of the best approach. My gut reaction would be fire a method that would resubmit the last page visited by all currently sessions, when the inventories submit form is successful.

Although I hadn't done any Flask development for about a year now, this was an incredibly fun little challenge to attempt. Ideally, I wouldn't expect this level of development to happen this quickly, due to change control, testing, and regular scrums dictating priorities, so it was nice to do something end to end for a change!
